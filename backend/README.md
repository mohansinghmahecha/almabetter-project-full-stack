## Description of project
Entertainment App: A Full-Stack Approach to Movie and TV Show Exploration" 

During that users have a consistent experience across all devices, whether they are on a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop.

Backend Development:
The backend was built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a lightweight and efficient environment for handling HTTP requests, managing user sessions, and interacting with the MongoDB database. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling unstructured data, which was particularly useful given the varied and dynamic nature of the data retrieved from the TMDb Api.
